:robot: `Back-end developer`
---------------------
Currently, we are looking for a Back-end developer with eager to learn Scala to join our team of professionals. 

Programming languages are at the heart of today‚Äôs technologies, and developers are as integral to progress as ever before. In the software development world, Scala combines object-oriented and functional programming in one concise, high-level language and has the reputation of being complex to learn. Research shows Scala is becoming a more sought-after technology.

Scala is designed to be a better language, shedding the aspects of Java considered restrictive, as a result, it is harder to learn, but the results are much cleaner and well-organized code, easier to use, and increase in productivity. Scala incorporates both object-oriented and functional programming concepts into a concise, logical, and powerful language. 

Mastering a new skill in this day and age can be difficult, especially when you‚Äôre trying to find a work-life balance. Therefore, we are offering an opportunity that includes a long-term, full-time position, learning a new programming language while you simultaneously receive a competitive salary; one that you will be happy with. During the initial interview stage, we will be evaluating your knowledge based on your strongest skill as noted in your curriculum vitae.

If you have the desire to learn new technology, you are highly analytical, and good at solving algorithmic problems, we can offer you a place to get yourself familiar and ultimately master one of the most in-demand technologies in the tech world right now. If you have the willingness to progress your career, we can offer you a safe place to do exactly that!
